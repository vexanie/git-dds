      <p>Great. So one of you is going to be Team Member 1, and the other one is going to be Team Member 2. <br/>I don't care how you decide who is who, but you have to pick now...</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>Have you decided yet? Good. This is your team:</p>

      <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
      <p>So both of you are going to be working on a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo" target="_blank">fork</a> of this website, but on separate laptops.</p>
      <p>Follow the next steps according to which team member you are.</p>
      <p>If you finish before your teammate does, wait for them before continuing; And help them out if they're stuck!</p>
      <div id="task1" class="row-fluid split-exercise">
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Team Member 1</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/pushmatrix/git-dds" target='_blank'>this repo</a>.</li>
            <li>Add your teammate as a collaborator on your fork.</li>
            <li>Clone the fork to your laptop.</li>
            <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser.</li>
            <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your code editor.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Team Member 2</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Watch/help your teammate with their first step. Back massage?</li>
            <li>When your teammate is done, clone their fork to your laptop.</li>
            <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser.</li>
            <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your code editor.</li>
            <li>Useless step added for symmetry.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
        <p>At this point you should both have the code open on your laptops. In your browser, you should be looking at the local copy of <code>index.html</code>&mdash; <strong>not</strong> the one at http://pushmatrix.github.com/git-dds.</p>

      <h1>Exercise 2</h1>
      <p>I feel like I don't know you well enough. Let's change that.</p>
      <p class="alert alert-info">Remember that you are doing this on separate laptops; Only complete the section according to which team member you are.</p>
      <div id="task2" class="row-fluid split-exercise">
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Team Member 1</h2>

          <h4>Name</h4>
          <p>Stephanie.</p>

          <h4>Interests</h4>
          <p>Sushi, video games, dogs.</p>

          <h4>Favourite Food</h4>

      <p>Perfect! Now you're probably wondering how to get your teammate's changes on your computer. Let the sharing begin!</p>
      <p>Follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open SourceTree.</li>
        <li>Notice that the <code>index.html</code> file has some changes to it: the changes you just made!</li>
        <li>Commit your changes. Make sure to type in a commit message to describe what update you are making. Example: <code>I updated my bio on the page!</code> </li>
        <li>Refresh the webpage.</li>
      </ol>

      <img src="img/ponder.jpg"/>

      <p>Hmmm...nothing changed; Your teammate's stuff is not there, and if you check your repo on github.com, your commit is not there! The reason is because you haven't pushed your changes to github yet.</p>
      <p>To make it work, you must both PUSH your code.</p>
      <p>Uh oh...one of your probably got an error. That's because you can't PUSH if someone has pushed code before you do. Don't worry, there's an easy solution:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the PULL button, then press OK.</li>
        <li>Now try pushing your code.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>What PULL does is get all the latest changes from github.</p>
      <p>You should now both be in sync! Refresh the browser, and your teammate's code should be there :)</p>
      <h2>OH YEAH!</h2>

      <h1>Exercise 3</h1>
      <p id="blinking-text">I should be <strong>red</strong> and blinking! If I'm not, then something is wrong.</p>
      <p>Admire the text above. It's beautiful, isn't it?</p>
      <p><strong>Javascript</strong> is what's making the text blink. You can see the code inside <code>index.html</code>. Can you find it?</p>
      <p><strong>CSS</strong> is what's making the text red. It is also in <code>index.html</code>. Can you find it?</p>

      <p>Sometimes it's good to have your css and javascript in the same files as your html; normally it's when you're just starting a project. But quickly your CSS and javascript will become big, and it will create a MASSIVE html file that is pretty confusing.</p>
      <p>That's why it's best to split them into their own files.</p>
      <div id="task3" class="row-fluid split-exercise">
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Team Member 1</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Take all the CSS and put it in <code>main.css</code> inside the <code>css</code> folder. Don't forget to save your <code>index.html</code>.</li>
            <li>Refresh your page. Make sure the text is still red. If it's not, you need to link the <code>main.css</code> file to your html.</li>
            <li>Commit &amp; push your changes to github.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Team Member 2</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Take all the javascript and put it in <code>main.js</code> inside the <code>js</code> folder. Don't forget to save your <code>index.html</code>.</li>
            <li>Refresh your page. Make sure the text is still blinking. If it's not, you need to link the <code>main.js</code> file to your html.</li>
            <li>Commit &amp; push your changes to github.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Before moving on, you must both be in sync. Make sure to press "PULL" so you have the latest changes on your computer. The javascript & CSS should be out of your <code>index.html</code></p>
      <h4>You make a great team!</h4>

      <h1>Exercise 4</h1>
      <p>Here's one of my favourite quotes:</p>
      <blockquote>&ldquo;DICKS DICKS DICKS DICKS&rdquo; &mdash; BONERGOD</blockquote>

      <p>Until now you've been changing separate areas of the code. But what happens when you both edit the same thing at the same time!?</p>
      <p>To find out, let's have a race. Countdown from 3, and then complete the following:</p>
      <div id="task4" class="row-fluid split-exercise">
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Team Member 1</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Change the quote above to something you think is even more awesome. It must be different from your teammate's.</li>
            <li>Commit &amp; push your changes to github.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Team Member 2</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Change the quote above to something you think is even more awesome. It must be different from your teammate's.</li>
            <li>Commit &amp; push your changes to github.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Let me guess what happened. One of you(clearly the cooler one) was able to push without a problem. The other one got some message complaining about 'Merge conflicts'.</p>
      <p>The following instructions are for the person who HAS the Merge Conflicts. The other person should watch you (and provide moral support).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to your <code>index.html</code></li>
        <li>Notice that where the quote is for Exercise 4, there are actually 2 quotes now, with some funny &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;HEAD stuff going on. <br>
        Everything between  <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;HEAD</code> and <code>=============</code> is your changes. <br>
        Everything between  <code>=========</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;somebignumber</code> is your teammate's changes.</li>
        <li>Now you have to pick which one to keep....</li>
      </ol>
      <p>How do you do that? Something like this:</p>
      <img src="img/duel.png"/><br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>When you've decided which quote to keep, modify the code so it looks how you want (remove the quote you don't want). Don't forget to remove all the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;HEAD crap.</li>
        <li>When you refresh the page, it should show the correct quote.</li>
        <li>Commit your changes, then push them to github.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Yay, the conflicts are resolved. Now make sure that both of your laptops are in sync. When they are, high-five each other and yell out your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QDAT1PlVyw" target="_blank">team battlecry.</a></p>
      <small>(If you haven't heard anyone in the class make those noises yet, then you're the first team to get here. Yay!)</small>
